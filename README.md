# 📱 Student Social Media Addiction Analysis

This project analyzes how social media usage affects students' daily lives — including its impact on sleep patterns, academic performance, mental health, and interpersonal relationships. We perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover behavioral patterns using visual and statistical techniques.
